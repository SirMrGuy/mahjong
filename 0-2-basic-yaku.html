            It's technically possible to win a mahjong game without actually winning any
            hands,<span id="footnote-tag-1"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span>
            and it's definitely plausible to sneak away with second or third as such. Nevertheless,
             we want to win hands when we can.
        </p>

        <p>
            Any winning hand requires a yaku (役). Almost every hand contains one of the following three:

        <p>
            These yaku fulfill largely complementary roles: riichi is only possible with closed hands, while
            yakuhai and tanyao are mutually exclusive. You should be declaring riichi on most of your closed hands
            for reasons we will discuss in later chapters. As for open hands, yakuhai and tanyao dominate:
            the next three most common yaku that are available for open hands (in order honitsu, sanshoku doujun, and toitoi)
            combine for around just one in ten wins, and many of the former two are achieved with closed hands.
        </p>

        <p>
            Already with these three yaku we can start to see the common tradeoff between hand speed and value.
            In particular, unless you get lucky and draw quite a few dora, open yakuhai and open tanyao hands will tend to be
            fairly cheap compared to riichi hands. However, they make up for this with speed, often allowing you to
            complete hands much more quickly, essentially by expanding the set of tiles that are available to you to
            include some of your opponents' discards. Keeping a hand closed and hoping for riichi is comparatively slower,
            and thus will make you win fewer hands, but generally is the best way to shoot for very large wins.
        </p>

        <p>
            How does this impact our strategy? One of the first considerations when we receive our starting hand
            should be to decide which yaku to pursue. Because of the primacy of these three yaku, in most cases
            they should be the first things we think of, and that will help guide the development of the hand.

                The state of having not won any hands is referred to as yakitori 
                (焼き鳥).<span id="footnote-tag-2"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-2" title="jump to footnote 2">[2]</a></span> 
                Under some rulsets, going yakitori for the whole game leads to a penalty regardless of your actual finish, 
                which discourages extremely defensive playstyles.

                Like the Japanese chicken dish, although I can't find any good sources on <em>why</em>
                it's called that.

                This table and other yaku tables like it contain the same columns. The first two are the Japanese
                name of the yaku, both romanized and in kanji or kana as appropriate. The third column is an
                English translation, basically aligned with Mahjong Soul with some compromises with the
                European Mahjong Association translations. The fourth is my attempt at a literal translation,
                although this is based on my knowledge of Chinese and so is probably not perfect. The fifth gives
                an approximate value for what proportion of winning hands have the yaku. This is taken from 
                <a href="https://amae-koromo.sapk.ch/statistics/fan-stats">this site</a> as of April 2024. For
                the most part the Jade hanchan stats are used. Generally the differences aren't very big, so
                I think it's fine for illustrative purposes.
