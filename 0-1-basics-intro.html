            Maybe you've just learned the rules of riichi mahjong and don't want to just flail around and luck into some wins.
            Or maybe you've already played quite a bit and want to review the fundamentals. Either way, this
            is the section for you.<span id="footnote-tag-1"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span>
        </p>

        <p>
            At an extremely reductive level, winning at mahjong consists of three things:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Winning more hands</li>
            <li>Winning valuable hands</li>
            <li>Not dealing into hands</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The first two maximize the points you gain, and the last minimizes the points you lose. Manage all three at once, 
            and you'd do very well for yourself. It's rarely so simple, of course; very often, pursuing one of these
            goals sacrifices the other two, at least to some extent, and managing these tradeoffs is a key part of being
            a skilled mahjong player. In any case, if you're a newer mahjong player, becoming proficient in these basic skills 
            is the first step in improving your play, and it's likely that implementing correct strategy can improve all three 
            dimensions at once.
        </p>

        <p>
            The chapters in this opening section will more or less follow that list. The first and biggest portion is devoted 
            to winning hands as quickly as possible, followed by chapters on maximizing hand value and defensive
            tactics.<span id="footnote-tag-2"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-2" title="jump to footnote 2">[2]</a></span>
        </p>
    </div>

    <footer>
        <ol class="footnotes">
            <li id="footnote-content-1">
                <strong><a href="#footnote-tag-1" class="footnote-return-link" title="jump back">[^]</a></strong>
                Conversely, these opening chapters will probably be below your level if you already
                feel confident about your skills, hence why I've numbered it 0.
            </li>
            <li id="footnote-content-2">
                <strong><a href="#footnote-tag-2" class="footnote-return-link" title="jump back">[^]</a></strong>
                Here, I'm distinguishing defensive <em>tactics</em> from <em>strategy</em>: the former tells
                you <em>how</em> to defend, the latter <em>when</em> to defend. In my experience the latter is substantially
                harder, so for the most part I've opted to save those discussions for later.
