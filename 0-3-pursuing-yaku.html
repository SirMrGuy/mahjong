            Essentially from your starting tiles, or a few draws in, you should have some idea of which yaku your winning
            hand will have. Supposing you're the South player in East 1, consider the following hands:
        </p>

        <ol class="example-list">
            <li><div class="hand-container"><div class="hand compact">
                <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">qweuuahjbm.77</span></div>
            </div></div></li>
            <li><div class="hand-container"><div class="hand compact">
                <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">wrryuidgvn,,3</span></div>
            </div></div></li>
            <li><div class="hand-container"><div class="hand compact">
                <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">rtuiofgkllzz4</span></div>
            </div></div></li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Hand <strong>A</strong> is a typical case where you would go for yakuhai and aim for a quick win. Tanyao is
            fairly undesirable given the completed <span class="tiles">qwe</span> run as well as the nice <span class="tiles">77</span>
            pair which you would have to get rid of. You could consider trying to keep the hand closed, but it's pretty unlikely
            that you can pick up a third <span class="tiles">7</span>, so unless you desperately need a bigger win then
            you'll probably want to pon the <span class="tiles">7</span> while you still have the chance and try to prevent
            someone else from winning the hand.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, in some cases, it can even be a good idea to call the other groups besides the yakuhai pair first, 
            in this case <span class="tiles">hj</span> and <span class="tiles">bm.</span>, with the plan of calling
            <span class="tiles">7</span> later. While this does carry some risk of 
            furiten if you end up with the yakuhai as your 
            wait,<span id="footnote-tag-1"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span>  
            this is generally not a big deal. Be careful, though, not to pon <span class="tiles">u</span>.
            This would leave your hand without a pair after you get a third <span class="tiles">7</span>. It's not the
            end of the world if you do, but <span class="tiles">uu</span> works just fine as the pair in your completed hand.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hand <strong>B</strong> is a good candidate for an open tanyao. Because there are relatively few tiles that
            progress the hand, it's going to be tough to keep this hand closed. <span class="tiles">3</span> would
            prevent us from getting tanyao, but discarding it is no big loss.
        </p>

        <p>
            In some sense, Hand <strong>C</strong> has the worst of both worlds. At least right now, there is no reasonable
            path to yakuhai, since even if we draw another <span class="tiles">4</span> it isn't the right wind. All of
            our terminals are also doing good work as parts of pairs or runs, so getting rid of them would be absurd.
            This is a hand that must stay closed; if you make a call, you're extremely likely to end up with no yaku.
        </p>

        <p>
            Not every hand is so clear-cut, especially those that are pretty far from winning.
        </p>

        <ol class="example-list">
            <li><div class="hand-container"><div class="hand compact">
                <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">qrydfhzxxm.36</span></div>
            </div></div></li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            To put it bluntly, this hand is not very good. We'll have to wait and see what our first few draws look like
            to be able to decide how to proceed. For instance, after two draws, the hand may look like any of these:
        </p>

        <p>
            Hands <strong>E</strong> through <strong>G</strong> start to resemble Hands <strong>A</strong> through <strong>C</strong>,
            respectively aiming for yakuhai, tanyao, and riichi, though all of them could potentially become riichi if
            they can stay closed and Hand <strong>F</strong> is leaving the door open for yakuhai. Some hands will have
            an obvious yaku to pursue, but for the rest it's important to stay flexible and adapt to the draws you get -
            trying to force one yaku or another from the outset to the exclusion of others would be a mistake.
        </p>

        <p>
            How do we keep our options open? In general, we should make discards in the following order:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Guest winds,<span id="footnote-tag-2"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-2" title="jump to footnote 2">[2]</a></span>
                i.e. winds that don't form yakuhai, in this case <span class="tiles">34</span> . These prevent us from
                getting tanyao and don't help in getting yakuhai. They also can't form runs and so will generally make
                our hand slower. Unless you already have a pair or triplet, you can freely discard them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Yakuhai honors, in this case <span class="tiles">12567</span> , that have already been discarded once
                or more. Since there are only four copies of each tile, if one has been discarded then it's going to be
                very hard to get all three remaining copies, even with one in hand. It's not unheard of, but keeping
                them around is more likely to just slow your hand down like the guest winds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Terminals, i.e. <span class="tiles">qoalz.</span> , that are disconnected from other tiles. This is for
                the sake of tanyao, of course, but in general the terminal tiles are less useful than the simple tiles
                since they form part of fewer runs. Still, <em>disconnected</em> is an important caveat: it's rarely 
                worth it to discard completed runs, pairs, or triplets just to chase tanyao. Even shapes like 
                <span class="tiles">qw</span> are often useful, and you should have a good reason before discarding them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Live<span id="footnote-tag-3"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-3" title="jump to footnote 3">[3]</a></span>
                yakuhai honors, i.e. those that have yet to be discarded. While we can hang onto these for a bit in the 
                hopes we get lucky and pair them up, in most cases we'd still prefer to have a simple tile rather than
                hold out for a second honor tile that may never come. After all, there are 34 kinds of tiles - even across
                an entire round of 18 or so draws, there's a good chance we won't get another one!
            </li>
            <li>
                Everything else, in particular simples as well as terminals and honors that are already grouped up. If we
                happen to only have simples then open tanyao can be a good option. Otherwise, we can go for yakuhai if we
                have a pair and keep closed otherwise.
            </li>
        </ol>

                <strong><a href="#footnote-tag-1" class="footnote-return-link" title="jump back">[^]</a></strong>
                The specific case here is when you have all of your sets completed except <span class="tiles">uu77</span> .
                If you happen to draw <span class="tiles">u</span> you won't have yaku, and discarding it means you can
                no longer ron <span class="tiles">7</span> . Something similar happens if someone discards
                <span class="tiles">7</span> right after a discard of <span class="tiles">u</span> due to temporary furiten.
                In both cases you can still call pon and discard <span class="tiles">u</span>, and then changing the wait
                tile, but this can be a pretty major speedbump.
